        <h1>Why Storm?</h1>
        <p>
          Technology is all over people's life nowadays. It is hard for us living without of them. However, stores just like JB HI-FI and Apple only offer standardised products to the customers. The phone covers or laptop covers provided are lacking personality. In the market, if the customers want some phone case or laptop case, the selection is limited. Most of the times, customers have to buy a standardised pattern or just plain cover. Even if they have any printing they like, they cannot do it by themselves. Storm offers customised phone cases and laptop based on the likings of the customers. This can offer a different experience to customers compared with the traditional way.
        Moreover, some of the customers would like to select the components of computer-based by their needs. There is not much company able to satisfy such need. Also, it is difficult for customers lacking profession knowledge in this area. Strom is here to help customers. Not only it can provide technicians to provide suggestions to customers who would like to assemble their computers also with the warranty, the customer can worry less in the long term.
